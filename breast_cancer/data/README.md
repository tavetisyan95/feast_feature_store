Note that the data files here will very likely be outdated by the time you see this repository. After cloning the repo and before using the code, make sure to:

1. Run the Jupyter notebook in the root directory of the repo to generate a toy dataset for the feature store.
2. Move the five generated files - `data_df1.parquet`, `data_df2.parquet`, `data_df3.parquet`, `data_df4.parquet`, and `target_df.parquet` - to `breast_cancer/data`.
